Idea: Expenses App

Screens

Home: This screen displays the current month and year. The user is able to add a budget, and that brings them to the budget screen. Once the budget has been inputted, the user is able to add expenses. There is a button that when pressed, brings the user to the expense screen. The remaining and spent funds update with each expense. The rest of the screen includes the expense history, which lists the expenses by most recent expense. 

Expense: The user has to add an expense amount, the category the expense falls under, the date the expense took place, and a note about the expense. The submit button is made available once all of these fields are complete. This submit button brings the user back to the home page. 

Budget: This is a simple screen that asks the user for a budget amount, and once they hit the submit button they are taken back to the home page. 

Sort: This screen allows the user to sort expenses by category or by price. Once the user selects a category, all expenses in that category are listed. When the user selects a price range (either high or low), the expenses are all listed in descending or ascending order. There is a home button at the bottom that allows the user to traverse back to the home screen. 

Parameters
Expense Data, which includes the amount, category, date, and note
Budget, which keeps the budget consistent across all screens unless changed at the budget screen
Enable button, which provides a boolean that can be change to enable or disable buttons depending on certain conditions
