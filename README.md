Screens
Home: This screen displays the current month and year. There is a button that when pressed, allows the user to add a transaction. The rest of the screen displays expense categories, such as food and health, and has the money spent in that category listed. This screen also includes the userâ€™s budget and remaining funds. 
Add transaction: There is an input component used to take in a number amount. The user can specify the category the transaction falls under. The user can select the date the transaction took place, as well as include a personal note about the transaction. There will be a button that when pressed, it saves. 
Categories: When the user clicks on a category on the homescreen, they will be directed to a screen with that category as the name. It details the history of transactions that fall under that category.
